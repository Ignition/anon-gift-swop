## About

A static website that creates gift swop assignments and allows blacklisting of certain pairings from a list of user-provided names.
The site generates a link to give to each person that states who they will be giving to.

## Frequently Asked Questions
### Why the British spelling `swop`?
The term "swop" is a playful variation of "swap" commonly used in British English. We chose this spelling to add a touch of charm and uniqueness to the project, reflecting its lighthearted purpose of gift exchanges. Plus, it helps differentiate our platform while celebrating diverse language conventions!
